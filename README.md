# Gold-Price-Prediction
A regression based machine learning model for predicting the price of gold based on it's influencers like Oil price, US dollar value, inflation rate, average of prices for the last 10 months taken into account in the dataset used. Moreover, I have also added some simple trading algorithm to predict when we need to buy or sell the commodity (gold) and also to predict the profit or loss when do the above. This was done during my internship at Cognibot and jointly with National Instruments on Machine Learning, AI and IIOT
